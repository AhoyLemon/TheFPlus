Chasing an idea that Lemon has had for about a year now, these are F+ engraved wood dugouts. One side holds a hollow aluminum bat (included) with cigarette pattern, the other side, depending on your local laws, either holds tobacco or marijuana. We couldn't tell you which. As a Minnesotan, I certainly couldn't attest to the efficacy of this design for recreational marijuana use in public places.

We've done a limited run of **40** dugouts, processed through an Etsy seller.

Ships via USPS, packaged in a 4"x6" bubble envelope.
