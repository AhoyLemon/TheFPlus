Text: Once upon a time in New Mexico, someone spilled a barrel of nuclear waste from old '80s action movies onto a pile of buried Atari cartridges in a landfill. The resulting mess caused the evacuation of the entire city of Alamogordo and also STOG. In his spare time he is a text-to-speech converter who plays video games.
