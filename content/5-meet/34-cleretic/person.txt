Text: Being Australian, Cleretic experiences the future before anybody else, and so he is a constant herald of things to come. After the Great Humor Drought of 2212, he was sent back 200 years into the past to ensure that The F Plus could plant what would come to be known as the Tree of Renewal. While here, he also knocked up a few women and made some choice real-estate investments. Just to be safe.
