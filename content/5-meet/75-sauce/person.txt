Sauce spends most of their free time pretending to be more interesting people, and most of their non-free time pretending to be a less interesting person. These people are generally still British though, so it seems like something of a pointless exercise.

They were raised in the traditional British fashion on a diet of boiled meats, potatoes, theoretically edible savory items referred to as “puddings”, and conspiracy theories about the royal family. They first tasted proper tea and real biscuits on a visit to the southern US in 2022 and vowed never to return. They still have the accent though.
