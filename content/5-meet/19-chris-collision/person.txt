Text: Chris Collision lives in Oakland, California. He likes his girlfriend Noodles, coffee, beer, bikes, cities, mezcal, HEAVY TUNES, Star Trek, (doing) the Jumble, (using) the text editor VIM, the politics of liberation, hockey, basketball, and essentially nothing else. (Okay, he sorta likes movies.) See you in the streets.
