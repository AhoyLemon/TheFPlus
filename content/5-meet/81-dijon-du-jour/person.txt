Text: This reader uses his wings to catch updrafts and soar across the sky in a calm and graceful manner. He gracefully glides through the clouds, often while singing or humming in a soprano voice. Dijon can be very affectionate, enveloping people he has bonded with in his cotton-like wings. Dijon is often found living in forests, though he also inhabits mountain ranges.
