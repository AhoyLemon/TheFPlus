Text: BomberJacket was originally a Squall Leonhart tulpa created by a lonely 30 year old woman in Baltimore circa December, 2008. One week after his creation, he gained enough sentience to realize what a shitty character he was. After escaping through a window and running to the county lines, he cut his hair, bought clothes that were actually his size, and started waiting tables. But in his free time, he ridicules those most likely to create tulpas online. Because fuck â€˜em.
