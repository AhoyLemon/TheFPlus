Text: Lou Fernandez is a NYC based podcaster & comedian. When he's not making his own podcasts, Lou Reads the Internet for YOU!, he is raising a family or wasting his time playing endless video games. Don't worry about hating him. You could never hate him more than he hates himself. Also, he gets like 4-5 hours of sleep a night so give him a break, okay?
