Text: The only living heir to both The Airokee Corporation (The World's only airline that's also a karaoke bar) and InnerMemento (offering a range of tasteful souveniers of your colonoscopy), Cheapskate's own personal wealth needs to be measured in numbers with exclamation points at the end. And yet, despite his massive fortune, Cheapskate maintains a lifestyle of appalling churlishness. His socks haven't been changed since In Living Color went off the air, and the only media he watches are ones in the public domain. Fortunately for all of us, he uses a hijacked internet account to make insightful reviews of this free media on Vimeo.
