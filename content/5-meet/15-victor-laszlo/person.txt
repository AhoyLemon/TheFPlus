Text: Victor Laszlo is a leader of the Czech Resistance.  He escaped the concentration camps, but that was in 1942 before anyone knew that you don't escape concentration camps.  After being reunited with his wife Ilsa, he made his way to Morocco where he pissed off some German officers by having the band play La Marseillaise.  It doesn't sound like much but it was more badass when viewed in context.  But the cherry on top of the Yay Victor sundae is when Humphrey fucking Bogart not only gives up the girl, but insists that Victor take her with him and then murders a man who wanted to stop them.  In the immortal words of Teen Witch, top that!
