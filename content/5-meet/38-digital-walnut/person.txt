Text: Constructed as a prototype for a failed Kickstarter campaign, Digital Walnut is mankindâ€™s first attempt at including tree nuts in the Internet of Things. It filters through thousands of pages of internet forum content each day in order to analyze human interaction and attempt to emulate it. Before being discarded by its creators, it was set to occasionally post on ballp.it, and it has since been hacked by the Russian mob to help individuals find horny MILFs in their area.
