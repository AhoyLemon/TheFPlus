Title: Adjudicated Guess

----

Text: 

An informational podcast that begins without information, Adjudicated Guess challenges its participants to come up with the correct answer using only the knowledge they came in with. Can logic, conjecture, and strong declarative statements be enough to discover the truth? Sometimes, probably. Other times, not so much.

This is another production from The F Plus.
