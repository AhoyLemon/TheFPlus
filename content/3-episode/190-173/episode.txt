Text: On this podcast, we've covered a lot of people who claim that imaginary things are real, BUT THIS... **IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT!** We're looking at the universe of "Djinn", genie having people who have either conjured or purchased a noble thousands-year old spirit that they make do the dishes. Then things get weird after that.  This week, The Thief of Baghdad is just looking for a nice cuddle.
