The **Dream Fiction Wiki** is a place where people work very hard to catalog, annotate and describe fake things that never happened. And while this may *seem* like a useless exercise, the actual determination of "which fake thing is a canonically real fake thing" is a topic that has caused a *significant* amount of drama in the community.

This week, uhhh.... so what's this episode about?
