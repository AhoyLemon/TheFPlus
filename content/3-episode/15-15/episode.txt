Text: It shouldn't be surprising for you to learn that there's groups of people who believe they've been abducted by aliens. Nor should it be surprising to learn that people have elaborate theories about aliens colonizing earth and playing an active role in our history and religion. But how about people that have communicated with digital monsters that exist inside of a Japanese cartoon? Couple all of this with spelling that is uniformly atrocious, and we've got ourselves a podcast.
