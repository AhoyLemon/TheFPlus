Okay, I think it's high time for **another food episode**!

This time around, A Meat and Montrith have provided us with a splendid menu of undercooked and shouldn't-be-cooked dishes, from appetizers all the way to desserts (with a special stop for Jello salads).  What we might be lacking in mayonnaise we're more than making up for in Cool Whip and a miscegenation of pre-shredded cheeses. This week, The F Plus does market research into the cultural appeal of ghost poop.
