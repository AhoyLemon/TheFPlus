So many video games are all about violence, where's the games with the sex in them? Well, it shouldn't surprise you to learn that they're *here*, and that's because they've been imported from Japan. Oh, and there's also a whole lot of violence involved, as well as massive amounts of misogyny and borderline beastiality. So... this is a gross one, if you haven't sussed that out yet.

We're exploring the **Monster Girl Quest Wiki**, an exhaustive resource for an actual JRPG about a boy who must protect his sperm from a myriad of horrifying creatures. This week, The F Plus is bummed out by Iron Maiden.
