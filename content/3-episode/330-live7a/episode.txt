It took us until our seventh F Plus Live to figure out that we could do it somewhere other than Minneapolis, and that we could do it in a theatre! We're so excited about the idea that we start things off with a musical number, before moving right in to reading crap!

1. 2 Wrongs Don't Make A Right (A Christian Puppet Play)
2. Ghost Stores from true-ghost-stories.com
3. I Don't Need That Junk (A Christian Puppet Play)
4. 7 Poems from nwanime.tv
5. Halloween Honesty (A Christian Puppet Play)
6. A question from Quora about Harry Potter and atheism

And this is only the first half of the experience: [Part 2 is here](/episode/live7b).
