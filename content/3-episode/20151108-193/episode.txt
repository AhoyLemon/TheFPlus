Text: 

Fanfiction is a complicated artistic endeavor. To connect with an audience, a writer needs to exploit a subject that resonates with an audience, and then serve concept, dialogue and action which the audience would find pleasing. Or, if you're the people behind imaginensfwoah, you skip all of that completely. The characters are non-specific, the setting is non-specific, but the action taking place is 100% disgusting. This is very much one of the grosser F Plus episodes, just prepare yourself for that.

This week, The F Plus is creeped out by that fifth dentist.
