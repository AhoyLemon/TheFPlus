Do *you* have alien-human hybrid children you've never met? Well it turns out that simply reading this means that *you do*. We know, we were surprised too. We're visiting the **Hybrid Children Community** - a group of people of similar class and ethnic makeup who want to tell you about their imaginary children. And then they want to share recipes.

This week, The F Plus is screaming with a huge smile.
