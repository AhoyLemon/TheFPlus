Text: In Spetember of 2022, The F Plus convened to make the same mistake they've made four times over: They will convene in the same Twitch stream for 24 hours straight and read 24 different documents' worth of _terrible_ content, all while rasing money for the **National Network of Abortion Funds**. Along the way, prizes will be offered, laughs will be shared, and suffering will occur. The Future is Garbage™.

  text: "Okay, we're starting things off with $4.20 in the donation pool, about 3 minutes of technical diffculties,  and a real desire to get reading the content of **Complaints Board**.  As Portaxx jumps on the pens, some lady gets her donuts thrown in the trash. We're just getting started with **24 straight hours** of terrible content, and now we've gotta find a ribs place that serves warm water and lemon."

  text: "The people have spoken, and the people want **horny video games**. So okay, let's get to it: We're going to start out in Pussy Paradise, move onto Pussy Licking As A Job, and just get grosser from there. We'll also be sharing what screenshots are possibly even slightly appropriate for this."

Leadout: 

Well, you've gotten this far, so that bodes well, but there's a lot of very stupid things in the next six hours: We've got **Pooner & The Snizz** as well as Bunnybread's very hour rap hour, some very stupid musical opinions, a whole hour of people stretching their penises, and lots and lots of drama.

[Part 2 is here](https://thefpl.us/episode/garbage-day-2022-part-2).
