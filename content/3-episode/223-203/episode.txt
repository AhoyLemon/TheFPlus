Text: 

Hoping to make some better decisions in his life, Lemon's been taking some time self examining his smoking habit. Then he reached out to his friend Montrith to see if she had any related reading material which would speak to cigarette smoking's effect on the body and mind. Then Lemon was reminded that Montrith knows only agony.

To that end, we take a long journey through Smoking Feels Good, and then close on Liberty Van. Then all that's left is for Lemon to edit a episode where the words "smoking" and "cigarettes" are uttered a couple hundred times.

This week, The F Plus needs a domain name for their new yellow denture business.
