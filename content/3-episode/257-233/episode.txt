Near as we can tell, the website Girls Ask Guys exists for two reasons: To provide women with insight  on the innermost thoughts that drive the actions of men, and to surprise you with autoplay music and ads. Near as well can tell, the website Girls Ask Guys succeeds at one of those two things.

This week, The F Plus has no patience for your dumb smart people games.
