Food blogging has a conundrum: People like to read and share recipes, but with there only being so many unique varients on "Sausage And Peppers", how can one particular food blog hope to cultivate its audience? Why, with ðŸŒŸzazzleðŸŒŸ of course! And words. Lots and lots of words. To that end, we're looking at one particular food blog, and specifically all the content that happens *before* she gets to the recipe.

This week, The F Plus feels that kind of excitement that only a new tub of Crisco can bring.
