For the 100th Episode of The F Plus, we wanted to take a couple of hours exploring the internet's stupid and misguided history, tackling some subjects from many years ago that have stuck with us like a herpes sore.

This is part two. Part one is [here](/episode/100a)

1. Alex Chiu Is Going To Make You Gorgeous
2. Matthew Moulton Has A Hard Time Making Friends
3. Why Is It That People Forget About The Elven Holocaust?
4. And Then Legolas Said "Which Voice Did I Use For This Again?"
