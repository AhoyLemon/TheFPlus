Text: 

Occultist author S Rob is an incredibly prolific... typist. His work spans the mediums of advice books, spellbooks, instructional videos, essays, general self-aggrandizement and, of course, poetry. We can't cover everything he's written in a single episode, but we can just cover the general tone. Including reading his bio twice.

This week, The F Plus sets sail on the SS Metathree.

*Correction: Boots' original reading of S Rob was at [F Plus Live 5: The Finnish Incident](https://thefpl.us/episode/live5b)*
