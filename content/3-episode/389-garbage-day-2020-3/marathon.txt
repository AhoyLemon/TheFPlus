    Let's get spooky! A-chill-ees Hell-ees takes us down a road of stupid terror as we learn about purchasable dolls with an actual, real human soul locked inside. What a gem! These dolls all have considerable backstory, and no refunds.
    
    There's also a little bit of haunted jewelry

    We've been anticipating it for months, and this is the Daniel Songer Comedy Hour. If you don't know who Daniel Songer is, this hour might be the best introduction. He's a comedian with a number of routines, but more than that - he's a comedian with a certain performance style.
    
    Adam Bozarth has collected the text of some of these routines, and his only rule: No doing a Daniel Songer impression.

    The Extra Credit hours begin here. We're on a Weebly site called FreezeRay Poetry, which describes itself as "words for nerds by nerds", so that means you're going to get terse, almost religious poetry about Game of Thrones, Iron Chef, Harry Potter, Mindy Kaling and the McElroy brothers.
