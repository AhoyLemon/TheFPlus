Text: 

As vaporizers became more popular in recent years, the internet did what it does:  turn an uninteresting pastime into a cultural signifier with its own jargon and infighting. And so were born "Cloud Chasers"; the men who risk friendships, wages, and their own personal safety in a never ending quest to exhale glycerine vapor in a cloud larger than someone else's. Actually, when you type it out it makes a whole lot of sense.

This week, The F Plus puts a finger in Missy's Wet Box.
