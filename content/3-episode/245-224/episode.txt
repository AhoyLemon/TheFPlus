Text: 

It's been too long since our last musical episode, but this one is worth the wait. We gathered together some of The F Plus' greatest hip-hop enthusiasts (and also Boots) to browse the internet's finest sources for hip hop lyrics; I'm talking about DeviantArt, WikiHow, Yahoo Answers, and some site from Colombia. The result will make you kill a rainbow.

This week, The F Plus lost their minds. Eight times!

### **REMIX THE F PLUS**

As mentioned, we'd like people to play with the raw audio files and see what they can come up with. We're presenting the raw audio in two different .zip files: Split by song, or in five full episode-length tracks split by person. Have fun, and please share the results with Lemon in one way or another.
