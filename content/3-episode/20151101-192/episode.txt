Text: 

Okay, we've spent a couple episodes highlighting the brilliance of people who consider themselves "idea people", but now it's time to spend some time thinking about the other end of the supply chain. Idea Connection is a website that caters to customers who are looking for a terrific idea that they can purchase from the website, along with any relevant patents for this idea. There's only *one* small problem to this: These customers do not exist because these ideas are really stupid.

This week, The F Plus is getting verbally abusive with our GPS devices.
