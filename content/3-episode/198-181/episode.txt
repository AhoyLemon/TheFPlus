What a wonderful time it must be if you're the owner of a crowd funding website! Presenting one such example, GoFundMe is a crowdfunding site where people can raise money for a cause without being hampered by constraints like minimums or timelines.  Is this a good model for persons deserving of help and/or charity? *Emphatically yes.*  However, as you might expect, none of the people covered in this episode are terrific examples of this.

This week, The F Plus is starting an anti-cowboy rodeo church.
