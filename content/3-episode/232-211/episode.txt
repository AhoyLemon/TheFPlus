For decades, David Icke has been speaking loudly and publicly about his hypothesis that Reptoids (that is, beings who appear human but who are actually decendents of the Lizard People who live in the center of the Earth) walk among us and are plotting to enslave humanity. And of course, that's interesting and all, but we're going to be looking at the forums of the David Icke website to read the opinions of the people who took this theory and ran with it.

This week, The F Plus better not be looking at pictures of *human* feet.
