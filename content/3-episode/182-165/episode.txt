Text: There's quite a bit of debate on the existence of ghosts, and all of those debates are stupid and pointless. But fortunately, there's a forum over at anybodythere.net that sidesteps the debate completely and cuts straight to the evidence. Psychic powers, paranormal investigators, chakras, demon lovers, it's all here and it's all spelled as poorly as you would expect. This week, The F Plus finds  one smiley particularly troublesome.
