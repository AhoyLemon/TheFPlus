Drugs Forum is (and this may surprise you) a forum where people talk about using drugs. That is, hundreds of thousands of people, over millions of threads, gathering to discuss the drugs they're doing, have recently done, or wish to do in the very near future. It's a vibrant community which, after many years, finally figured out the best way to go rollerblading.

This week, The F Plus is your salvia...vation. (edit point)
