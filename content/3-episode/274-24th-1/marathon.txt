This is 24 Terrible Hours: a full day podcasting marathon celebrating bad writing and raising money for the Southern Poverty Law Center. It was broadcast live on March 31, 2017. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

In our first couple hours we have some logistical stuff to figure out, but we soldier on because there's important work to be done.

    We start out our first ever marathon experience the right way: By immediately breaking our own website and then brodcasting a bunch of dead air while we panic and try to figure out what to do about it.
    
    Eventually that's resolved and we settle in for the task at hand: Reading the pontifications of fetishists. It's gonna be a fun 24 hours.
