Text: 

The **Aesthetics Wiki** has devoted itself to the cataloguing of hundreds and hundreds of aesthetics and subcultures which are seemingly identical to each other. This may seem like a pointless excercise, but that's just because you're being real Grandparentcore right now, and I'm experimenting with Darkest Academia.

This week, The F Plus is trying to get your attention. BLUT BLUT BLUT BLUT!
