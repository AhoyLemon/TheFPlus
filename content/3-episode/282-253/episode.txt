Text: 

The proprietors of online crystal shop **EnergyMuse.com** inform us that “almost ever [sic] ancient civilization has utilized Earth energy—in the form of crystals and gems—in some way.” And if you think that statement is suspect, let me ask you - do you *really* understand what that means? I'm pretty sure nobody does.

This week, The F Plus isn't sure who stole that joke from whom.
