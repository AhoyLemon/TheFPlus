This is Garbage Day! Another 24 Terrible Hours with The F Plus to celebrate bad writing and raise money for the Southern Poverty Law Center. You'd think we'd have learned our lesson.

We had a strong start, so let's dig in deep to the next six hours of Garbage Day. In this section, we rant about sports, aliens and ghosts.

    There's a lot of words involved to the Mormon-Alien conspiracy, and few of them make any sense. For that matter, few of them are about Mormons.
    
    But Adam takes us through Mary Sutherland's fever dream of reptoids, booteans, and dinosauroids. Pay attention, damn it!

    Quite a while ago, The F Plus recorded an episode on Freeballin' (or: The Exquisite Pleasure of An Underwear-Free Lyfestyle), but for reasons I don't recall, the episode was lost.
    
    For this Garbage Day, we're bringing it back, and as Adam found out *it's grosser than we remembered!*

    It's Bunnybread's turn to host for the hour and things get very hot very quickly as we bring you raps like "Warm It Up, Taint", "Oops! Poop", "dxm n lsd influenced me" and "HYFR I Did Bath Salts"

    Frank West is still alive! We hand over the pens to Trav as we try to make it to the halfway point. This hour: Sports suck!
    
    That's a sentiment that some (not all) of The F Plus' participants would agree with, but it's a statement confused when you realize it's all the wailings of one overweight man in El Paso complaining about the heat.

    Lemon starts out the hour by telling the viewers their opinions on the Dead Kennedys' album "Frankenchrist" are incorrect. He is reprimanded for the next hour.
    
    With Lady Frenzy on the pens, we answers some very stupid question with some very stupid answers, all the while looking at the donations in horrible horrible fear of what will come next.
