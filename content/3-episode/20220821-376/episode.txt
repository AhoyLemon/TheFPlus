Good news everybody! The forum members of **OverUnity** have solved all our energy problems. They've created perpetual motion machines, 3 million terawatt batteries, balloons which are heavier than lead and other assorted contraptions that provide much more energy than they'd ever require. Only one problem: They can't tell you any specifics, because of Google. We're spending an hour and a half solving all the world's problems, and we're getting rich besides.

This week, The F Plus will sue you if you infringe our Boomer Blocker® patent.
