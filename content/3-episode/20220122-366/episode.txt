Text: 

Hang on, didn't the F Plus do a Mandela Effect episode before?  Well, this reality has us going to the **r/MandelaEffect** subreddit, before realizing that **r/Retconned** is even stupider and spending all our time there instead.

This week, The F Plus is gonna drink Goldschläger until the loaf shifts.
