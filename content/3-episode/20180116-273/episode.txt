There's a couple hundred thousand members of CandlePowerForums and I don't mind telling you: those folks are *really* into flashlights. In what is probably our most jargon-filled episode, we're exploring the predilictions of these (exclusively) men who want to share their obsession with their wives and children, who are having *none of it*.
