Text: There's so many opinions on the internet, and those opinions are held by people who take considerable effort to try to convince others that their own opinion is correct.  But what happens if you want your opinion to be changed by facts and persuasive arguments that others provide to you? Well, hypothetically you go to **r/changemyview**, a subReddit where people  share their own opinion, and then sit back and carefully consider every conflicting opinion that's presented to them. In theory, this is a *terrific* idea! This week, The F Plus discovers the White Power Black Hole.
