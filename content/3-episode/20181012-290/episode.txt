Text: 

With half a million works in their catalog, the marketplace at the strangely named **Smashwords** describes itself as “your ebook. your way”. And, as long as “your ebook” is a christian cyberpunk business-minded erotic novalla and “your way” is with rambling paragraphs and keyword-stuffed sentences almost nearly as difficult to follow as this episode description, then you, my friend are in luck. It's all descriptions of ebooks this time around, folks. Settle in.

This episode, The F Plus knocks at the door of a woman in an illegitimate manner (and the whole spiritual realm is on alert).
