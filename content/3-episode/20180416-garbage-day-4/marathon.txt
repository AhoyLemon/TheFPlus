This is Garbage Day! Another 24 Terrible Hours with The F Plus to celebrate bad writing and raise money for the Southern Poverty Law Center. You'd think we'd have learned our lesson.

We'recoming into the end here and you better believe we're gonna stick the landing.  Juggalo Poetry! J/O Instructions! Wikihow! It's all here!
