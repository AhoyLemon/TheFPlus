Text: 

If your chakras are all out of wack and you're in the market for new ugly jewelry, **Skydin Zeal** would love to be your supplier. The owner of a website with where every single word is printed in every single color (and with bevels and gradients besides) you may get lost along your way, but when you're done you'll lose weight because your flatware will physically prevent you from eating.

The week, The F Plus wants one of those big pussy cars like what Joey Rembrandt paints.
