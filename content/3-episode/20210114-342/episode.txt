You might have guessed, but **Root Beer Review** is a site that hosts reviews of different root beers. What you might not have inferred is that all of these reviews are (probably) written by the same person, and the other people on the website have *opinions*, not just on the root beer, but on the person reviewing the root beer as well.

This week, The F Plus smells terrible like vitamins and raisins.
