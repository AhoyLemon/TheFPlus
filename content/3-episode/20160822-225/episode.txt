The internet is an exciting global landscape under constant dynamic upheaval. I have no idea what any of that means, but we're talking about tech startups here, so it doesn't really matter. We're looking at a site called IdeasWatch where people can pitch their ideas for an interesting app or innovation and *then*... well, nothing. It's ignored forever.

This week, Lemon's still figuring out how to use his new microphone (sorry).
