This is 24 Terrible Hours: a full day podcasting marathon celebrating bad writing and raising money for the Southern Poverty Law Center. It was broadcast live on March 31, 2017. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

Time gets the best of Lemon and the surviving Ridiculists seek comfort while speaking of electronic genital restraining devices, anime girl pillows, and what might be the worst looking food we've ever seen.
