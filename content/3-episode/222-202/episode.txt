Text: 

Life can be frustrating at times. To that end, there are sites on the internet where people can go and type the subjects of their anger into a form for others to read. These screeds can be on any subject, and restrictions of logic, spelling or grammar do not apply. Also, posting a screed usually means you get involved in flamewars with the other users of this website. And while *none* of this is helpful for the people involved in posting on the website, the results can be read aloud and help you feel better about yourself.

This week, don't smash your keyboard. A portal might open up.
