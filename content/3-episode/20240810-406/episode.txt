The subreddit of **r/morbidquestions** is (I suppose) meant to ask and answer thought-provoking yet dark questions. However, this is a subreddit, so therefore most of the questions are stupid edgelord nonsense, and the replies are banal upvote jockeying.  But there's a *lot of posts*, so we've got plenty to work with.

This episode, The F Plus wants to know: Is Christmas Carol a good porn name?
