The world can be a scary place, and that's why the folks at BUDK Worldwide are there, day after day, to use that fear as a tool to sell cheap worthless crap to rubes with self esteem problems. We're here for the swords, but there's a *lot* of categories on offer here and it's easy to get distracted.

This week, The F Plus opens the box and BAM THE FREAKING BANKAI SWORD OF ICHIGOS
