Text: 

Nation States is a game where players can create their own idealized version of a country, ally with other nations in the game, pass resolutions, and vie for supremacy. Separate from that, the *forums* of Nation States is a place where people post in character as emissaries from their fictitious countries to brag about their totalitarian regime and brag about which memes are the dankest. The results are infurating.

This week, you still like Huswyae, right?
