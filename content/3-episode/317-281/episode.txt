Biohack.me is a place for "grinders". That's a word with many definitions, but to the forum community at biohack.me, a grinder is someone who cuts themsleves in order to stick something in the wound, like a magnet or a USB stick. As you might imagine, this episode is a bit *intense*, and I think we came close to making one our readers pass out. So just know that going in.

This week, The F Plus regrets clicking on the image links.
