Text: 

There's a lot of peculiar naming conventions in unusual internet fetishes, which makes the **Wet And Messy** fetishists very appreciated. They like it when people are wet and messy! And they have many many many words to prove it.  They also have a whole lot of pictures to prove it, but we needn't concern ourselves with that.

This week, The F Plus learns something about Southern Hospitality.
