Text: 

Working in retail can be a stressful and thankless experience, but as in all things, the internet is there to help. NotAlwaysRight is a place where visitors can share their stories of totally pwning the customers they had to deal with and how impressed everyone was with that experience.

This week, The F Plus wonders "God, what is this madness?"

PS: Lemon apologizes in advance for confusing [Kevin McCarthy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002994/?ref_=rvi_nm) with [Mark McKinney](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571897/?ref_=tt_cl_t4). It's eating him up inside.
