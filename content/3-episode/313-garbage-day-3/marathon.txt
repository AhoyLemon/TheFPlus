This is Garbage Day! Another 24 Terrible Hours with The F Plus to celebrate bad writing and raise money for the Southern Poverty Law Center. You'd think we'd have learned our lesson.

We're over halfway done and we've got  a lot of work to do still. This is definitely grossest chunk of hours, as evidenced by the fact that the live stream viewers paid to make us start this section off with Sissykiss. It gets *less* gross from there, but that's a complicated thing to measure.

    Alright you bastards: After a $2,500 bidding war, our fate is decided and while Shell Game works the pens, we're forced to read some goddamn Sissykiss.
    
    If you aren't familiar with Sissykiss, you are very lucky indeed. Congratulations! Don't hit play and ruin your life.

    Now we've got Sanguinary Novel on the pens, and she starts out the hour with a seance to conjure her art supplies whie Boots tries to figure out if he sang a song or not. It's worth checking out those props in our gallery, by the way.
    
    Aaaaaanyway, let's all get scared shitless by TV Tropes, okay?

    What is The Greenland Theory? Well, we spend about an hour reading about but I'm still not sure I could explain it to you.
    
    I can tell you this: It's... intricate?

    Transformers are robots. They aren't real. They're fictional robots. I just want to mention this up front because the content of the Transformers Kink Meme is unsettlingly sexually violent and you need to remember that Transformers are fictional robots to get thru it.
    
    Shell Game gets her hat.

    We start out the hour with Boots Raingear singing the theme song twice because the first time he didn't realize that he wasn't recording.
    
    That out of the way, Jack Chick is your host and he takes us through the many peculiar fetishes on display at Clips 4 Sale, including the naughty bits of Ayn Rand.

Leadout: We're almost there, folks! The [final 6 hours](https://thefpl.us/episode/garbage-day-4) will contain Juggalo Poetry, Jerk off Instructions and WIKIHOW! Keep going, you're not done yet.
