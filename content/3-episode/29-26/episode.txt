Text: Since 1998, throngs of internet users have come to AllRecipes.Com to learn how to make the meals they've been dreaming of, and share recipes of their own. It's a site visited by literally millions of people, including clinically depressed housewives and lifelong bachelors with erectile dysfunction. What do these people like to feed themselves? Really horrific things. This episode, The F Plus has the sodium levels of the South China Sea.
