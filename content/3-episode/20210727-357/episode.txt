Text: 

None of the websites we read in this episode are still online outside of archive.org, but all of them follow one basic rule: Every conspiracy theory must have been written before 50 Cent's In Da Club. In stark silence, do you hear children crying?

This week, Victor finally wins an episode.

**Lemon's note:** I'm still very much interested in an Artainment cassette. [Contact me](https://thefpl.us/meet/lemon).
