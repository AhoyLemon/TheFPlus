Text: 

The topic of male circumcision is a contentious one, but fortunely we're able to avoid all of that by simply reading the words of dullards who are doing horrific things to their own skin while complaining about their mothers.

This week, The F Plus would like to remind you foreskin fetish does not make sense because the foreskin is part of a man's sex organ.
