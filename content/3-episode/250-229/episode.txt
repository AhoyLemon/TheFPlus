Our brand new intern is in the mix while Lemon forgets which setting his microphone is supposed to be on and we explore the science behind *The Concave Earth Theory*! Popularized by Steven Christ, The Concave Earth theory states that [onomatopoeia where you stick your pointer finger between your lips and move it up and down while going "bwee bwee bwee bwee"], *and* it's got forums, so we're set.

This week, GMan just won't stop lying about pushups.
