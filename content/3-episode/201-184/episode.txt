Text: We've teased it out a couple of times, but now it's finally time to figure out what this watch fetish document is all about, although I cannot say that anyone is going to come out of the episode having had all their questions answered. But regardless, we're gonna be spending time on Watch Girls Forum; where people are very specific about their particular kink, plus I suspect it's British as well. This week, make sure you wear your watch on the right wrist.
