Text: Deviating ever so slightly from our typical podcast formula, this is a dramatic reading of two different pieces of Transformers fanfiction. One is called Ravage 3 Bodies Evolution, and the other is called Dinobot's Old Technology. Our readers play various roles, and bring the thing to you in the style of a radio drama, which no doubt was the intent of the authors.
