Text: 

Christmas can be a tough time of year for many people. Sometimes spending time with family is the challenge, and sometimes just not spending time with anybody can be the challenge. In those dark, difficult times, mankind has historically turned to songs and literature and poetry to find a beacon of light, guiding us through the darkness and into the light. Unfortunately for Jack Chick, this is The F Plus and so instead we're making him read some more godawful Christmas poetry so you can find glee in his misfortune.

This week, oh god no its happening again!
