This episode is all about **medbeds**. So what is a medbed? Well, first of all it isn't a bed, so let's just get that out of the way right now. It's possibly an MLM scheme, or maybe it's a bucket, but sometimes it's a mobile phone app that takes a picture of your bed, which may or may not prevent and cure all diseases.  Do you have any questions? Great, so do we. In fact, this episode is mostly us asking questions.

This week, The F Plus learns the true meaning of Technotronic's Pump Up The Jam.
