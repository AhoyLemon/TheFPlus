Over time, the sociological constructs of multiplayer video games have bled ever more into the regular lives of sexually active adults. Whether with strangers or known companions, the construct of team dynamics in a pseudoviolent situation become more commonplace and more complex. Which is, of course, *very sexy*. To that end, this is an episode about **r/healsluts**, a community of people who extrapolate video game healing into a dom/sub relationship, because of course they do.

This week, The F Plus allows you to hump a pillow.
