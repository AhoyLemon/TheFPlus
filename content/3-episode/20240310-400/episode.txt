Text: 

One night, Lemon and four ridiculists read a document made entirely from stories from **Not Always Right** which were tagged as "inspirational". Then (six months later), Lemon and four other ridiculists read the exact same document. This episode is the result of those two recordings.

This week, The F Plus is releasing our 400th episode which means we have to show up two hours early and get thrown right into the mix with no time to sit down and make a cup.
