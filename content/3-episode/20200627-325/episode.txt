Text: 

The folks over at **Bulletproof** tried selling coffee with butter in it. And not only did that plan work, but their customers were willing to pay a premium for the experience. So with that lesson learned they expanded the product line: Protein bars, tinctures, vibrating platforms, books, computers with pre-installed software. These are products designed to* reverse the aging process*. And if that sales pitch sounds compelling to you, please give me your credit card information.

This week, The F Plus puts the coconut in the fire to relieve this bellyache.
