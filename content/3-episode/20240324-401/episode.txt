Text: 

While the internet has made us more interconnected, the world remains a massive place. And travel is a way to build a greater understanding of The Human Condition: To live among others in unfamiliar settings and experiences, you can learn more about yourself, and grow to be a more compassionate and empathetic person. Like, hypothetically. **Or** you could just go on Trip Advisor and write a poem about getting drunk in Cabo San Lucas. Your call.

This week, The F Plus is all DIRTNASTY.
