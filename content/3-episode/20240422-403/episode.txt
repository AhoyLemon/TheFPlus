Jo Joe Skies started a forum. On that forum is a single thread. That thread has 300,000 replies. If we exclude the posts made by bots, each and every post is Jo Joe Skies replying to himself with a new important message. What kind of things does Jo Joe Skies post? Well, if I told you the forum's color scheme is yellow on cyan, does that give you an idea?

This week, can The F Plus live with you? Can The F Plus move in with you right away?
