Text: 

Rather than describe what's happening on **The Crytpidz Wiki**, I'll let the site describe itself: 
> Cryptids are monsters... except that cryptids could actually exist! When talking about Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster you're talking about something that could live right on this Earth right now! On Cryptid Wiki, we document all of the possible information you can get about cryptids and determine if they're real or not.

This week, The F Plus likes Utah, and that's pretty dang interesting!
