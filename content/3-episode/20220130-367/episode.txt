After over 15 years of cultivating some of the dumbest questions The Internet has ever pondered, a series of truly horrific business decisions forced **Yahoo Answers** to shut down permanently on May 4th of 2021. Our memorial episode may not be timely, it may not be well thought out, and it may not be informative - but in all those ways, this episode is representative of Yahoo Answers itself.

This week, The  F Plus is burning all our documents (but unrelated to that, Jeff had a fantastic orange)
