Text: 

The formalized lottery exists in most of the United States and lottery tickets are purchased at a rate of more than $100 billion a year,  yet when it comes to the matter of actually *winning the lottery*, we're supposed to believe it's all random chance? Surely the people at **Lottery Post** know better; It's a forum where people share lottery numbers and lottery number systems, and we can confirm the numbers totally work, *except* for the whole "winning the lottery part", but other than that, they're great.

This week, 4.
