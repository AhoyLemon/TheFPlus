Text: If there's one thing that Conservatives, as a whole, have decided about the internet, it's that it has a liberal bias. YouTube has femmy kids crying about Britney Spears, so conservatives created GodTube. Google News feeds talk about American casualties in Iraq, so conservatives created The Free Republic. And Wikipedia says that Iran Contra happened, Nixon was impeached, and G. Gordon Liddy went to prison, so conservatives created Conservapedia. This is a site which is not so much meant to inform the publc (rather the opposite on a number of occasions), but is meant to reenforce stereotypes and fuel agendas. And it is delightfully insane.
