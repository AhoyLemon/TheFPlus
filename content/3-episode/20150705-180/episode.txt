Text: There have been some recent controversies surrounding reddit, where just because of the actions of a few hundred thousand bad apples, the future of the website and of the fracturing social network is in question. But we at The F Plus are looking at the kind of thing the world would be missing out on if Reddit were to disappear today. To that end, we're reading the fetish prompts at r/dirtypenpals, to find the profiles of some netizens who are looking for love even though they are unlovable. This week,  The F Plus is offering free drink refills and bottomless polka.
