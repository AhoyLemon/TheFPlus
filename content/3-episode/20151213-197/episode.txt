It's been years since our last full journey to Yahoo! Answers, and it's actually kind of comforting to see how little the site has changed. From topics ranging from Race Relations in America to Anime Appreciation, as well as the ever popular "Hey, how do you spell the word pregnant?", Yahoo! Answers has always been a very reliable source of baffling and unintentionally hilarious questions from across the Internet. As long as there's a question, someone will have an answer, and sometimes that answer will just raise further questions.

This week on The F Plus, Lemon just *can't* read the word "fights" for some reason.
