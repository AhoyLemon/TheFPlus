There's a lot of enthusiastic wrestling fans in the world, and some of them dream of one day becoming professional wrestlers in their own right. In the real world that would take a lot of diligence, luck, and willingness to adopt a lifelong addiction to painkillers - but this is the internet: a place for dreamers.

Enter **eWrestling Encyclopedia**. It's a place where ideas are more important than physical spectacle, and those ideas are things like "Another wrestler that already exists except he has my name instead of his own name". Thought provoking stuff.

This week, The F Plus loves it when rappers make albums.
