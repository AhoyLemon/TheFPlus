Text: 

The promise of the website **Spells of Magic** is very compelling: Over 16,000 spells to help you do things like turn into a dragon, make friends with a dragon, look like a dragon, or be a mermaid (who is also a dragon). And while that all sounds great, Tadashi and Nekoshema are in the comments and... well, they've got bad news for you.

This week, The F Plus buys tickets to see Dub Mumbledoor.
