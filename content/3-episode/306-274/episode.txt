Text: 

In a complete departure from our usual approach, we spend this episode composing and reading text using Botnik's predictive text generators: the system used to write [Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash](http://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html). We give that a once over, and then play around with our own, including a Nicki Minaj song, Seinfeld beat poetry, and some crossover fic.

This episode is a bit o' knickers.
