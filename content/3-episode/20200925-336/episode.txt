Text: 

The website **Bigfoot Eruption** has a whole lot of things to say about Bigfoot. Now, Few of those things make a lot of sense, and fewer still seem to be internally consistent, but the important thing is that Cain and/or Adam and/or Satan is involved, it's a conspiracy, and it's not a bear. Pay attention to your dog.

This week, The F Plus gets a lot of milage out of that poo.
