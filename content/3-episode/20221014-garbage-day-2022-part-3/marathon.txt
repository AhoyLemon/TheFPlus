Text: We're halfway through our Escape From Garbage Day and things are looking... complicated. First we've got Lou (and Lou alone) reading possibly the grossest thing we've ever covered, and then Lemon wants to introduce you to his Indigo Children, after that, Shell Game grabs the controls for four straight hours of **Extra Credit**. It's a real doozy.
