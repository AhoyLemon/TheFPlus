Text: 

Five lucky ridiculists from The F Plus Podcast were selected to visit the forums of **VacuumLand.Org **and read what they found there.
You’ll be happy to know that a love of vintage vacuum cleaners totally isn’t a fetish, except for the times when it is.  But they’ve got some pretty incredible vacuum collections that they bring to conventions, and also, eventually, it will be time for poetry.

This week, The F Plus will need you to hide this in your closet for our boyfriend to smell.
