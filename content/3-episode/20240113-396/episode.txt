Text: 

While their name might confuse you, the **NoPoo** community is actually dedicated to abstinance from the use of shampoo. They have all realized that by not using _any_ cleaning product in their hair, they will all end up with hair that is healthy, luxuriant, and beautiful. So their only question: Why is my hair thinning, waxy and smelly?

This week, The F Plus is tried for warcrimes at the Showerhaig.
