We've focused on a lot of people with varying mental disorders, so it's time to talk a little bit about mental health. Andy Kadir-Buxton is an unlicensed medical practioner who, in addition to a number of other profound and confusing accomplishments, has invented a cure for "a wide variety of mental health problems".

In addition to learning about the Kadir-Buxton Method, we'll also be discussing a number of Andy's other discoveries, his contributions to the British Space Administration, and his petition supporters.

This week, The F Plus has an orgasmic nose.
