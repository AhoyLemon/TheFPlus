Text: To start this episode off, we took a look at the popular television show Mythbusters, or to be more specific: Fans of Mythbusters who have odd predilictions for things that happen on the show. Then we ended up getting distracted by one Mythbuster's fan comic strip called Conquistodogs. And finally, we read the twitter page of someone who likes The F Plus.
