Text: 

The redditors at r/ZeroCarb have a particular diet they want to share with you, and here it is: **Meat**. Meat at the exclusion of literally everything else. Every other comestible on the planet contains toxins, so they've found perfect health. Also they're all getting hives and incontinence and a myriad of sexual, respiratory and sleep problems, but that's probably entirely unrelated. 

This week, we don't mention Jordan Peterson too much, so *that's* nice.
