Sooooo..... Fleshlight has forums. Did you know this? We didn't know this. Spooks found out about it and now that's what we're reading.

As it turns out, this is a surprisingly active forum with a community of members who discuss the finer details of the plastic sleeve that they masturbate into. With that comes some of the standard themes you'd expect, like Harry Potter and gay panic.

This week, The F Plus gets it on while Jimmyfranks is jammin' on his bass guitar.
