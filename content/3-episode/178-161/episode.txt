Text: Vampires, as a concept, tend to fall in and out of favor, depending on the trends of popular culture. And with that shift in trends, so too is there a flux in the number of people who pretend to be vampires for whatever reason. But fortunately, there is help!  Steve Leighton, the proprietor of vampirewebsite.net is a REAL vampire,  and he has tips on how to find out if you are also a real vampire, and then how to distinguish yourself from the fakers. This week, The F Plus works on the pilot for our vampire sitcom.
