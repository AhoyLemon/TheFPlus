Text: 

The human mind is a very confusing and (in some cases) profoundly stupid thing. And for the merchants and community of WarpMyMind.com, that can only mean one thing: *opportunity!*

The purpose of this website is that some users will post hypnotic "curses" which cause the listener to do things many would find undesirable, such as a shift in sexual orientation or an inconvenient orgasm. Then, even more bafflingly, other users show up to purchase these curses and then kvetch on the forums about how terrible their life is now that they're cursed.

This week, we find out what the F+ British Accent sounds like when it's a dog.
