Text: 

The website **MyFirstTime.com** was launched in 1997 to collect stories of formative sexual experiences from its visitors. Those stories are, on average, outright fabrications written by people whose pornography habits influence their worldview. As you read the actual content of some of the more popular stories posted, you'll recognize that's a good thing.

This week, The F Plus will touch your pinacolada with our hands. Whooopee!
