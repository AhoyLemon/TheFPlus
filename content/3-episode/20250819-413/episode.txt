Text: 

So, pretty much every chain restaurant has its own subreddit, and we''re gonna look at at least half a dozen in this episode. From annoying customer complaints to terrible menu ideas to lots of poop problems to conspiracy theories, and even time for poetry at the end, this is really the Rax Salad Bar of F Plus episodes.

This week, The F Plus is a purely transactional podcast.
