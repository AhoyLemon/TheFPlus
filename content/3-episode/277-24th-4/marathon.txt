This is 24 Terrible Hours: a full day podcasting marathon celebrating bad writing and raising money for the Southern Poverty Law Center. It was broadcast live on March 31, 2017. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

This is how it ends: First, Achilles' Heelies poisons himself before Adam Bozarth goes it alone, Montrith eats some crap and Lemon wakes upand tries to figure out what's going on, Sanguinary Novel draws a lot of penises, and goddamn motherfucking **wikiHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**. This was a great idea, let's do it again tomorrow.

Leadout: In the end, we raised **$5,420** for the Southern Poverty Law Center and weakened our collective emotional center in the process. Thanks to everyone who participated in every way they participated. It was... something. It was something, that's for sure.
