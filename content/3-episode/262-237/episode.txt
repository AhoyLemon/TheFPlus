While Grindr may have revolutionized the way people have anonymous gay sex, Craigslist is still a useful repository for people looking for gross furniture, seedy "modeling" jobs and unpaid gigs for exposure. But in addition to all that, they apparently have forums for some reason.

In this episode, we're looking specifically at the Ettiquite forums of craigslist, to learn how we can all be better mannered participants in the human race, mainly by gaslighting our husbands.

This week, The F Plus popped your pussy and toggled your tits.
