Text: 

The Passions Network presents a unique value proposition: What if, instead of making one dating website, we create literally hundreds of unique (in name, but largely identical) websites, in the hopes of luring in customers with a whole bunch of super-specific niches? What would happen if we did that? The answer, it turns out, is an F Plus episode.

This week, try to find who loves to suck guys. Yam!
