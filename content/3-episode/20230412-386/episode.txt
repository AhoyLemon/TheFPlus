Text: 

I really don't know how the people of **royalcello dot website toolbox dot com** found each other, but they've found each other. And all of the posters here believe in a single inalienable right: The Right To Rule, or rather, to be ruled, sometimes by royalcello himself who gets *very testy* if you say anything unkind about Charles III. Look, none of the people featured in this episode know much (if anything) about The Monarchy, but they do know they like it, and at least _one_ of them knows The Hapsburgs belong in Spain.

This week, The F Plus wants Catherine The Great to sit on our face.
