Text: Otherkin is a word used to describe a group of people who believe that, in addition to being human, they also have the soul of some other creature, which is typically a dragon, a werewolf, or some other fictitious beast. For some reason, nobody ever believes they have the soul of a three-toed sloth inside of them, even though that seems the most appropriate.
