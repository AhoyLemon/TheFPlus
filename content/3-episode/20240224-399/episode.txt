We're only _one episode away_ from our 400th episode, and we're gonna spend it on the quadfecta of tumblr, reddit, fandom and deviantart. Today, we're looking at the **Reality Shifting** community - people who are certainly _not_ dreaming (oh no no no), but they're using their own positive intentions to transform themselves into a completely different and better world (like the kind where you have an orange), while your clone body does all the chores your mom keeps bugging you about.

This week, The F Plus also likes the pop culture thing you like. Enjoy!
