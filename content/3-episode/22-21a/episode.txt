Text: Juggalos are a group of people who dress up in face paint and carry plastic hatchets because they're really into a white rap group who does just that. Making fun of juggalos on the other hand is so commonplace that even Saturday Night Live is doing it now. But you're clearly mistaken if you think that's going to keep us away. This is an episode of juggalos describing themselves in their own words, and clearly it won't make any sense.
