Text: 

ComicsNix is a somewhat prolific fan fiction author who became a brief point of internet interest after writing a story where Severus Snape has sex with all the Teletubbies. But that's passé now, so we're off to explore his other, more intellectual works — like the one where Batman has sex with Robocop in order to stimulate amnesia, or the complications that arose after Bella Swan summoned Satan to be her personal bodyguard.

This week, The F Plus learns vengenge is a dish best served could.
