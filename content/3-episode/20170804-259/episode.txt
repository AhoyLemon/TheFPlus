Hello, podcast listener!

This is an episode about making food with bodily fluids. If you're familiar with what we do, you're probably going to like this episode a lot. If you've never heard this show before, this isn't the one to start with. Maybe try a [wikiHow episode](https://thefpl.us/episode/176) instead?

This week, we're sending back this Galliano shot.
