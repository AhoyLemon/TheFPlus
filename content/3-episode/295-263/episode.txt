Previous subject notalwaysright.com (which titles itself as "Not Always Right - Funny & True Stores") has sections other than the one where cashiers totally own customers and then everyone applauds afterwards. In this episode, we look at **Not Always Romantic**, allegedly true and allgedly funny stories about couples being really adorable together. It is absolutely dreadful, so we talk about other things instead.

This week, The F Plus has to leave if you say the word "period".
