You probably don't know what **The Pooh's Adventures Wiki** is, but as of this episode, it has over 80,000 pages. Comprised mostly of fanon crossovers with other popular media franchises and embarassing self-inserts, this is a wiki where eventually all of popular culture can exist parallel to Tigger.

This week, The F Plus enters the Ryaniverse.
