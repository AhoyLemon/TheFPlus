The Movie Ideas Wiki is (and this is going to come as a surprise) a wiki wherein people write and catalog ideas they have for movies. But (and this may come as an even bigger surprise) the ideas posted on that wiki are crap. So Boots was thinking "Hey, what if we read these crappy ideas out loud, would that be funny?" The answer may *shock* you!

This week, The F Plus gets challenged to a Ponytail-Off.
