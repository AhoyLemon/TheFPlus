It's the first episode of 2026! What better was to celebrate the new year than an episode that won't mention 2025 at all. This episode of cryptocurrency songs was recorded in September 2024, and is now ready to be released to your podcast wallet. The only criteria for inclusion in the document is that the songwriter mentions Bitcoin at least once, so there are pro-Bitcoin raps, anti-Bitcoin protest songs, and some steampunk bullshit found its way in there, too.

This time, the F Plus asks why won’t you let me play my gaaaaaaaaames?
