Text: 

While **bluelight.org** is not the only drugs forum on the internet, it has had about two decades to collect nearly half a million users, many of whom are very excited to share their experiences of the things they've done, thought, and said while on drugs. And most of those things are about trance albums, apparently.

This week: Dilute, dilute, dilute! OK, OK, OK?
