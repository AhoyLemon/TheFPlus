Text: Twilight, as you are no doubt aware, is a poorly written series of books. Which has since become a poorly written series of movies. And yet, despite the undeniable crapulence of the material, there are throngs of people devoted to the love story of a elderly vampire and his teenage love interest who he feels like killing. What the hell, you ask? So do we! Let's examine the Twilight fans together, shall we?
