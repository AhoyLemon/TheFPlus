This is the audio for F Plus Live, part 1. All of these recordings are also available on video, thanks to Mique. We've put together an F Plus Live 4 playlist [right here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbDEABAdDXRXFljldOh2tpa0qPzkUkjmG).

We'll confess up front that the audio is... well, it's as good as it is. Lemon spent many hours trying to clean up the sounds, and believes it's good enough. But the content is what matters.

The audio and video were each cut differently, each contain stuff the other doesn't.
