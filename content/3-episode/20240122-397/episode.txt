**Replika** is a service that provides AI-powered "artificial companion" chatbots to sad and lonely redditors, who then will immediately try to use it to talk about Harry Potter and indulge in their fetishes. They will then opine about the nature of consciousness, and the results aren't great.

This week, The F Plus is *taste so gooding*.

    In this chapter, Lemon conceives of and
    then performs a joke based on the XTC
    song “The Ballad of Peter
    Pumpkinhead”. It is a really excellent
    joke that Boots Raingear truly
    appreciates and this almost certainly
    ends up being his favorite joke of the
    entire episode.
