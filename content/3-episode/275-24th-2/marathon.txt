This is 24 Terrible Hours: a full day podcasting marathon celebrating bad writing and raising money for the Southern Poverty Law Center. It was broadcast live on March 31, 2017. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

As the donations continue to roll in, the listeners make us read a horrible thing. Although in fairness, both options were horrible. Frank West gets freed from his purgatory and you end up hearing the Windows alert noise less.

    bumpgrrl subjected this to us and then
    dropped out with technical difficulties,
    sticking us with _The Goddamn
    Omergaverse_. On a better note, Frank
    West concludes his journey.

    Our second donation battle winner. This
    hour lasted much longer than all of the
    other ones somehow.

Leadout: You don't know what suffering is yet. Keep going to [part 3](/episode/24th-3) where we quickly figure out we chose the wrong thing to read, then make Jimmyfranks redo his previous life choices, and then figure out we haven't done anime body pillows yet.
