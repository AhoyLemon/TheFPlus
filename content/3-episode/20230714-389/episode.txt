Text: 

The subreddit of **r/CreepyEncounters** is a place where redditors post true stories of lived experiences that are disurbing, strange, paranormal, or somehow otherworldly. I mean, ostensibly. In our experience, the stories are dubious, meandering tangents of fictional self-inserts that frequently fail to meet the definition of "story". But if you were looking for a preamble of what an allyway is, you're in the right place.

This week, The F Plus wanted mythological beats, but Socretes is just a man.
