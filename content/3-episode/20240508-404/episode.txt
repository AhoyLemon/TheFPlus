Text: 

At some point in the 1970s, an American named John Swigart changed his name to Aajonus Vonderplanitz, insisted he had a PhD, and started writing books insisting that people should eat raw meat exclusively. Then he died. Later, a group of redditors started **r/rawprimal**, where the #1 rule is "You cannot give advice that Aajonus didn't already give first." The result is what is very possibly the *dumbest group of motherfuckers* we've ever covered on this show.

This episode, The F Plus observes The Moldy Berry Protocol.
