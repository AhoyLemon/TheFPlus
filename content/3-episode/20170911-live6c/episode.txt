For the last segment of F Plus Live 6, we consult a supercomputer and our nearest available Frank West to learn that we have not yet collected enough magicks to summon Satan. And so, we take drastic measures.

1. **Lemon** & **The Audience**: badfic snippets
2. **J W Friedman**: Read how Katy Perry's video Firework is witchcraft and how the spell is cast
3. **Adam Bozarth**: The Yahoo Answers of Spanky Gazpacho
4. **Frank West**: Shelia Thong Sandal Goddess by mrstanley

Lemon's reading (provided by Lady Frenzy) was cut for time and then performed the next day at the karaoke afterparty. [Here is a video of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7i2_cBuFus).
