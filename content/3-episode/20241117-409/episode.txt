Text: 

Eva Draconis has had sex with multiple transdimensional lizard beings  (Reptilians, Orions, and regular old dinosaurs) including a red Dragon Turtle named Hamish who she communicates with telepathically, and who sleeps in her bathroom on a rug and gets jealous of her Sims characters. And I know you're thinking you've heard all of this before, but just wait til we get to the bologna sandwich.

This week, The F Plus gets waterboarded, no big deal.
