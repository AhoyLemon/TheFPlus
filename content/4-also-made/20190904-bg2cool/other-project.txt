I was recently looking at a library of modern minimalist web design patterns and found myself immediately and overwhelmingly bored. We've reached the point in web development where minimalism is a disease.

And this is the cure.

[BG2.COOL](https://bg2.cool) is a pattern library of seamless patterns for you to use in your radical website. Choose the options on the site, and it will generate CSS for you to use in your project.
