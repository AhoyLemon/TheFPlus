Born out of a running joke on the podcast but then evolved into something far more interesting, [The Wrongest Words](http://www.wrongest.net) is a party game where you and your friends struggle to provide the very stupid statements given to you. The game is played on any device with a modern web browser, and supports 3-8 players.

This project was retired on **March 20th, 2017**. Details are [here](https://ballp.it/index.php?topic=2527.0). The full repository is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/AnotherDole/wrongest) should you find it useful.
