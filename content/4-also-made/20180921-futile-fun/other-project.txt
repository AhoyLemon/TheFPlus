Do you love playing repetitive games, but you just wish they could be even more depressing?

No?

That makes sense, it’s a very stupid thing to wish for. And futile.fun is a very stupid thing. It's a game that puts you in the role of Sisyphus, the Greek king condemned by the gods to an eternity of performing an unplesant and pointless task. Reminds you a lot of your job, doesn’t it? Except this game has achievements
