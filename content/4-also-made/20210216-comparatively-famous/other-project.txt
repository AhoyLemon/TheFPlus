A couple weeks ago, we finished recording an episode and then (and I don't remember why), we just started looking at different celebrity prices on Cameo. As the conversation progressed, we started to talk about certain values in relation to other values, and then what this whole thing would look like as a game. The next day, I started making it a game.

It took about a week and a half.

This is a single player game about guessing different celebrity prices on Cameo.
