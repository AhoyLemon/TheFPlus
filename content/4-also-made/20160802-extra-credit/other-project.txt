Extra Credit is a podcast made by listeners of The F Plus. Spearheaded by Amelia Blank, it picks up on The F Plus's lead and goes through the items that The F Plus didn't pick up on for one reason or another - because they didn't get around to it, because it's really gross, or what have you. They are the Go-Bots of podcasting - taking up the podcast's lead, but doing their own thing with it. Join them, won't you?
