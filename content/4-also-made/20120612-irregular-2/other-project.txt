Text: 

For our second episode, we have a meandering conversation with three very different people inside the furry community. Kaye Devin (a shiba inu who does commission art), Veneer Maro (a snow leopard who just got her first fursuit), and Ari (a lion who is proud of his kinks).

We spend about an hour talking about the genesis of realizing that you are a furry, the procurement and utilization of fursuits, and the plusses and minuses of the furry community as a whole.

Music: L'Aguardiente by Camper Van Beethoven
