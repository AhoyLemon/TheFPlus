After spending an idle hour on NameCheap and seeing that damn.dog was available, Lemon realized he had to buy it. Then, domain purchased, he had to figure out what to do with it. The answer: A WikiHow Illustration Guessing Game.

Each round, damn.dog will generate a new (actual) WikiHow article image, and you have to guess which (actual) WikiHow article it was made for. As always with projects like this, source code available and pull requests welcome.
