**Invalid** is a multiplayer multibrowser game that launched the kinda.fun platform.

The premise is fairly simple: Each round, there is one SysAdmin and everyone else is an employee. The employees want to create a password. The SysAdmin wants to make that as difficult as possible.

There's a [wiki](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/kinda.fun/wiki/Invalid) and an [explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhA83jtHmzM) you could watch, but the best way to get started is just to round up some friends and start playing.
