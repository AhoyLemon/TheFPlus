**idiots.win** is a game that challenges you to discern the logic of what people are searching for on Google. Each round, you are presented a search term and a list of autocomplete results, and your job is to figure out which of those results actually comes in on top. The results are pulled from Google's autocomplete function on each turn, and may skew to your own location, although even though it's using Google's autocomplete, this project is completely unaffiliated with Google, just so we're clear.

Source code available, pull requests welcome.
