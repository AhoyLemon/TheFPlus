Portaxx contacted me a week before F Plus Live 2 and said she wanted to make a real cartoony cartoon to show. I've known Portaxx long enough to know that she's not the type to make idle "wouldn't it be cool if" chatter, but I was skeptical that she'd actually be able to put a cartoon together before the thing. And it turned out that she could.
