Irregular is a whole new podcast concept we've been working on for a little while, and we hope you're as pleased with the result as we are currently.

Differing from The F Plus, the idea behind Irregular is to actually have subjects on the show, and to have a conversation with them about what makes them who they are. This is very much a side project which won't be done as often as The F Plus, but it's a concept we're excited about and based on the strength of our first episode, we're hoping to make some more of these.

In the first Irregular episode, we have a lively discussion with three very different Kindleporn authors. There's (link:http://www.amazon.com/Jessi-Bond/e/B007DM5D46/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 text:Jessi Bond), (link:http://www.amazon.com/Francis-Ashe/e/B006YTHST2/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 text:Francis Ashe) and a secret guest who wishes to remain nameless for reasons that will become obvious fairly quickly into the episode.

We spend about an hour and a half talking about the business of erotica publishing, the inspiration necessary for writing stories about vampires having sex with their stepfathers, and the sideways efforts of censorship.

Music: L'Aguardiente by Camper Van Beethoven
