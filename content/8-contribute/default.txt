We do this podcast for the same reason you listen to it: Because it's fun. But it's a fun that comes with its own costs and a *lot* of time expended in everything involved. To that end, we'd like you contribute. Here's how...

### MONETARILY
1. Register for a [paid account](http://ballp.it/index.php?action=profile;area=subscriptions) on ballp.it.
2. [Donate](/contribute/donate) via PayPal.
3. Buy some [merch](/merch) please.

### OTHERWISE
1. Tell your friends about the podcast.
2. You've probably got a social media account or three. Share some links to your favorite episodes.
3. Try submitting [a document](/submit).
4. Dig into the [F Plus codebase](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/thefplus) or [ballpit codebase](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/ballpit) on GitHub and make improvements to the site.
5. We like those [drawings](/fanart) you do.
6. Ballp.it has bulbs, but no "most bulbed" section. [Wanna build one?](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/ballpit/issues/1)
7. Got another way you wanna help? Send [Lemon](/meet/lemon) a message.
