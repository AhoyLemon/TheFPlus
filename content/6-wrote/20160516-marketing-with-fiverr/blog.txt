In the beginning of May, we published a blog post explaining our basic premise: We received a $20 [donation](/contribute/donate) with the instruction that the money should be spent on the outsource freelancing site Fiverr. The idea was a sound one, so we opened it up to the community.  People would suggest Fiverr gigs and vote up their favorites. I would buy the 3 gigs that got the most bulbs (the ballpit equivalent of upvoting), as well as purchase a fourth based on my own criteria. What follows is the result...

1. [Purchasing](#purchasing)
2. [Scream Your Name Into A Bush](#bush)
3. [I will dace in bikini with Vladimir Putin mask](#putin)
4. [I will make a stop motion animation for you](#animation)
5. [I will promote your ad on Christian podcast](#xian)
6. [Results](#results)

#### Purchasing
I purchased all 4 gigs on the same day, and the race was on. I tried to give as little instruction as possible, and I did not want to send revisions, but to let the creators interpret the requests as they would and post the result.

The first thing I found out is that a five dollar purchase on Fiverr actually costs $5.50, as there is a  50 cent transaction fee. The transaction went through the F Plus PayPal account, which would incur a 46Â¢ fee so that adds up, but I'm unclear how much Fiverr takes as a cut. Please let me know if you do.

I'll list the gigs in order that I received results back. All the videos are at the bottom.

#### **Scream Your Name Into A Bush** by e_ressett
Suggested by Down10 | Received **19** bulbs.
Expected Turnaround: 3 days | Actual: 3 days

Here's what I sent e_ressett:
> The F Plus is a podcast. A number of people are aware of this, but (to my knowledge) zero bushes have been made aware of this fact. Can you please inform some bushes that The F Plus is a podcast?

A couple days later, he responded with an mp4 video for me to download. I am personally quite pleased with what we got.

#### **I will dace in bikini with Vladimir Putin mask** by Whosthatgal
Suggested by Lemon (no bulbs)
Expected Turnaround: 4 days | Actual: 4 days
[Gig page](https://www.fiverr.com/whosthatgal/dace-in-bikini-with-vladimir-putin-mask?funnel=84e52610-fcca-4da2-ac0b-ce2df306693f) on Fiverr

Before ordering, I sent a message to Whosthatgal verifying that I could request she dance to a song of my choosing. She said that would be fine, so I sent her an MP3 of [This Lady Frenzy remix of Jimmyfranks singing](https://soundcloud.com/lady-frenzy/jimmyfranks-warrior-lady-frenzy-mix) which I felt would best match the menace and terror conjured by watching a dancing half naked woman with Vladimir Putin's head. A few days later, she sent me a video, at which point I had to type this unique piece of correspondence:
>  So, this is wonderful, except I see in the video that you are wearing underwear and a rubber chicken head mask, but I actually made the order for the Vladimir Putin mask.

She apologized and shortly thereafter sent me a second video as described, but my immediate reaction was that it had the diminished energy of a second take. I thanked her for responding, but am choosing to use the chicken head video as the canonical one, as there is more twerk.

#### **I will make a stop motion animation for you** by Candlehour
Suggested by Portaxx | Received **62** bulbs
Expected Turnaround: 8 days | Actual: 7 days
[Gig page](https://www.fiverr.com/candlehour/make-a-stop-motion-animation-for-you) on Fiverr

This one started out a bit tricky. For the audio to be used, I sent a slightly pared down edit of *The Kumuqatxop "Yeah" Megamix* from [episode 168](/episode/168). However, as that mix contains the words "semen", "menstrual blood", and "what are your sex fantasies?", the creator balked at the suggestion and immediately wanted to cancel. I asked him if I could recut the audio, and he said that would be fine. So I cleaned out the naughty bits and sent a recut piece of audio. He tried to upsell me with some extra features to the video, saying that what I would get is two unmoving characters talking without props or background. Feeling that fit the tone that was meant to be conveyed, and having an unshakeable curiosity towards "What does $5 worth of stop motion animation look like?", I said that fit my needs perfectly. Even with the intial hiccup, the video was completed ahead of time.

#### **I will promote your ad on Christian podcast** by Iassist
Suggested by moooo566 | Received **29** bulbs
Expected Turnaround: 14 days | Actual: ???

This was a trickier one to think of, because while the idea is conceptually funny, there are two basic problems in that: 
1. A Christian Modern Living podcast with a demographic of mostly middle aged women is emphatically *not* what I see our demographic as.
2. I didn't want the thing to come across as "I'm trolling squares", since there's ways this could be done that would read as mean spirited.

The gig offers to play your 1 minute long audio ad in the first 10 minutes of the show, so I had a quick beery conversation with Bunnybread and we came up with the idea of a straightfoward ad explaining that The F Plus is a podcast and you probably shouldn't listen to it, which to be frank is good advice for a lot of people. Bunnybread cut the audio real quick and I threw in some public domain music.

[Here is the MP3 we sent to her](https://goo.gl/7tkKXB).
