If you aren't familiar with the concept, [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com) is (hypothetically) a website where you can promote your brand.

For the baseline cost of $5, you can engage in such innovative marketing ideas as [pay somebody to hold your logo while wearing a Pikachu outfit](https://www.fiverr.com/meerion/hold-a-sign-of-anything-you-want-in-either-my-pikachu-outfit-or-normal-clothes) or [say anything you want while dressed as a sexy shirtless pirate](https://www.fiverr.com/badbeehavior/say-anything-you-want-as-sexy-shirtless-pirate?context=advanced_search&context_type=rating&context_referrer=search_gigs&pos=9&funnel=5f9bff01-833f-4959-ac80-4423a3330b0e&autoplay=false) or have your logo appear in a [goddamn nightmare](https://www.fiverr.com/babawhitesheep/make-my-bjd-hold-a-sign-with-any-message) or simply [cast a spell to give you money](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_in=everywhere&source=top-bar&locale=en&query=money+spell&page=1). All this, of course, is very useful, but something we haven't had the opportunity to take advantage of until now.

Through the [contribute page](/contribute), we received an anonymous donation from a person who left the explicit instructions to spend this money on Fiverr promotions, and that's exactly what we did.

The results are detailed [here](/wrote/marketing-with-fiverr).
