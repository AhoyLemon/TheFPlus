Last year we collected $8008.69, let's see if we can reach a larger, yet still immature number this year. 

Things to expect:
* Live art by several very talented artists
* Frank West playing the entirety of a terrible video game
* (link: https://thefpl.us/meet/tommy text: Tommy)
* The finest lyrics from RapPad.com, the world's easiest site to mine content from

* Prizes you will not be able to obtain anywhere else
* A generally overwhelming quantity of dumb shit
