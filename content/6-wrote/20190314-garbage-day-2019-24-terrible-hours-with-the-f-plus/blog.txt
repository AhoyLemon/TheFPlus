It's back. **May 18, 2019** at 12:00pm EDT we will be live performing [24 hours of The F Plus on Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/TheFPlus) and raising money for the [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/). Last year we collected $8008.69, let's see if we can reach a larger, yet still immature number this year. 

Things to expect:
* Live art by several very talented artists
* Frank West playing the entirety of a terrible video game
* (link: https://thefpl.us/meet/tommy text: Tommy)
* The finest lyrics from RapPad.com, the world's easiest site to mine content from
* At least one T'was the Night Before Christmas parody
* Prizes you will not be able to obtain anywhere else
* A generally overwhelming quantity of dumb shit

**Albert**, the mascot of Garbage Day 2019, was drawn by [Sanguinary Novel](https://thefpl.us/meet/sanguinary-novel)
