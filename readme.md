# The F Plus


This repo contains all the template and design files which make [thefpl.us](https://thefpl.us) work and operate the way it does. It does not contain the content or the kirby source files, as those aren't really relevant here.

To get this repo up and running, first [download Kirby](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirby) and then copy over the contents of this repo into your folder. You now have a working version of The F Plus ready for content.

This project is kept on parity with what's currently happening on The F Plus website, and is primarily used for version tracking for me as well as to try to demonstrate everything I'm doing to make the site work. If you have a question or suggestion on how to make anything better, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/TheFPlus/issues).

If you have an idea on how to improve the site, please contact Lemon before putting in a pull request.
