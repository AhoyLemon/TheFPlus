# The F Plus

This repo contains all the files which make [thefpl.us](https://thefpl.us) work and operate the way it does. The website is built on Bastian Allgeier's [Kirby  CMS](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/). As this site uses [Kirby 2](https://github.com/getkirby-v2) rather than Kirby 3, the architecture files are kept in this repo as well. This repo also contains the site content, which is more-or-less current at any given time.

This project is kept on parity with what's currently happening on The F Plus website, and is primarily used for version tracking for me as well as to try to demonstrate everything I'm doing to make the site work. If you have a question or suggestion on how to make anything better, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/TheFPlus/issues).

If you have an idea on how to improve the site, please contact Lemon before putting in a pull request.
