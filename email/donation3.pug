    p I'm sending you this email to make sure you know that I appreciate your recent donation.
    p Ours is a show that we make because it's fun for us. Nobody's getting rich or famous off this thing, we're just spending a lot of our own free time making stuff we like, and it's cool that you like it enough to spend your own money on it.
    p So thanks for that.
