It's approaching one year since F Plus Live 3: Bad Romance, and we're getting very excited about the prospect of doing it again, so we are in the planning stages for **F PLUS LIVE 4**. The date and location have both been confirmed, everything else is currently a work in progress. This page will be updated as more information is available.

* [Kumquatxop](/meet/kumquatxop)
* [bumpgrrl](/meet/bumpgrrl)

* [Chris Collision](/meet/chris-collision)
* J. W. Friedman (of [I Don't Even Own A Television](http://idontevenownatelevision.com/)) 

<br />**NOTE:** The above is not a complete list of expected attendees, more should be added as travel plans are confirmed.

The theme for the evening is **bad fanfiction**, and there's plenny of it out there. We've had a number of dreadful suggestions given to us, but we're always looking for more. so if you've got a bad fanfiction book or story you think really needs to be read, send it along to us.

**This event is 21+**. We're at a bar, and the show will run late, so this really a fact we can't change.

This event has always been incredibly fun in the past, and I can tell you that there's a lot of excitement in making it happen again. There will be drinking, there will be terrible things read, it will (if history is any judge) be great. Check back for updates, maybe we'll see you there.
