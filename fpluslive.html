It's approaching one year since F Plus Live 3: Bad Romance, and we're getting very excited about the prospect of doing it again, so we are in the planning stages for **F PLUS LIVE 4**. The date and location have both been confirmed, everything else is currently a work in progress. This page will be updated as more information is available.

<br />**NOTE:** The above is not a complete list of expected attendees, but just the people who have set their travel arrangements. More ridiculists (and possibly some special guests) will be added to this list as they set their affairs in order.

Our working concept at a theme is poorly written fanfiction. We are currently trying to source this, but are having some difficulties. If you have hideously bad fanfiction books/stories you'd like to suggest for the live show, *or* if you have a different concept at a show theme, please either email lemon @ this website or make a post on ballp.it. While I'm at it, if you'd like to design or illustrate a poster for the event, please contact Lemon for that as well.

This event has always been incredibly fun in the past, and I can tell you that there's a lot of excitement in making it happen again. There will be drinking, there will be terrible things read, it will (if history is any judge) be great. Check back for updates, maybe we'll see you there.
